  <h4>A few quotations from thoughtful people  . . .</h4>
 
  <div class="container">

  <h5>The First Aphorisim of Hippocrates:</h5>
  <p>
    Life is short, the art long, opportunity fleeting, experiment treacherous, 
    judgment difficult.
  </p>

  <h5>Some Thoughts from Maimonides:</h5>
  <p>
    Teach thy tongue to say 'I do not know,' and thou shalt progress.<br>
    Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; 
    teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.<br>
    The risk of a wrong decision is preferable to the terror of indecision.</p>

  <h5>Francis W. Peabody in his final lecture at Harvard Medical School October 21, 1926:</h5>
  <p>
    The good physician knows his patients through and through, 
    and his knowledge is bought dearly. 
    Time, sympathy and understanding must be lavishly dispensed, 
    but the reward is to be found in that personal bond which forms 
    the greatest satisfaction of the practice of medicine. 
    One of the essential qualities of the clinician is interest in humanity, 
    for <em>the secret of the care of the patient is in caring for the patient.</em>
